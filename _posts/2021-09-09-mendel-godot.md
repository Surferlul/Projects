title: Godot Mendel's principles
---

This is my old version of an implementation of Mendel's principles.

The program works but its UI looks really bad and the code is absolutely horrible.
I am working on a new version written in rust and with gtk3 as the UI with a much smaller and more efficient code base. I will post the link to the new repo here when I'm done.

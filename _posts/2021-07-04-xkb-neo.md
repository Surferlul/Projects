title: xkb neo
---

My xkb modifications for making neo etc (inclusive vou) work properly with every part of GNU/Linux. YES, even Java Applications.

For programs running through XWayland manually execute

~~~bash
setxkbmap de vou
~~~

to get proper keybindings working.

If your Windowing System is X11 you might need to remove the package "numlockx" and log out to get the keyboard layout working properly.

**Execute patch.sh to patch your system**

Or Manually:
- execute patch_xkb.py as superuser to patch /usr/share/X11/xkb
- execute enable_gnome.sh to enable alternative keyboard layouts on GNOME

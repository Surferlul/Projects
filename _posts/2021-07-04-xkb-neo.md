My xkb modifications for making neo etc (inclusive vou) work properly with every part of GNU/Linux. YES, even IntelliJ \[Doesn't seem to work on gnome anymore tho :(\]

Execute patch_xkb.py as superuser to patch /usr/share/X11/xkb

Execute enable_gnome.sh to enable alternative keyboard layouts on GNOME

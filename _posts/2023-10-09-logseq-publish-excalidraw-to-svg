Excalidraw drawings are not rendered when published in logseq. This action makes sure that they are converted to svg and inserts the svgs

This needs a helper repo or branch to upload the svgs to.

## Inputs

| Input | Requred | Default | Description |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ----------- |
| dark-mode | false | false | If svg should be rendered for a dark-mode theme |
| asset-repo | true | | The repository to store the svgs in. Has to be public |
| asset-repo-branch | true | | The branch of the repository to store the svgs on |
| asset-repo-token | true | | An access token with content read/write to that repository |

## Example action:

```yaml

  contents: write
